# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the C programming language.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend on the same computer.
- **Command Line Interface**: Simple text-based interface for a nostalgic feel.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid moves and prevents overwriting existing ones.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner or a draw.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language


## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Follow the prompts to enter the names of the two players.
2. **Make a move**: Players take turns entering the row and column number to place their mark (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.
3. **Win or Draw**: The game will announce the winner when a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or declare a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
